# UnrealEnginePlayground


This github page is meant to show off mechanics and experiments I've been working on in Unreal.
There are two projects, one for a First Person Perspective, the other for a Third Person Perspective.

First Person Project:
- Hovering Objects
- Picking up Objects
- Mini-Map
- Grappling Ability (Pulls player to hit objects) (Uses Raycasting, and Cable Component)
- Debug Draw & Sphere Cast
- AI That follows you
- Pick Up Objects, add them to inventory. (If an object can be highlighted, it can be picked up. Press 'E' to pickup. Press 'I' to display inventory)
(If you open this project, don't Press F)

Third Person Project:
- Rotating Objects that could be pickedup/removed/destroyed on touch.
- Blocks that are a random colour upon starting the project
- Animation Tree (Recreated something basic the default character already does using an animation tree to examine how it works)
- First Multi-Threading Test (Located inside TPPlaygroundCharacter.h)
